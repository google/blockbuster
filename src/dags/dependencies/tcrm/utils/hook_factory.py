"""A TCRM Hook factory.

The factory functions in this util file can create any type of hook given one
of the types in InputHookType or OutputHookType.

Any new TCRM hook should be registered in this file to allow for it's creation.
To add a new hook:
  - Import the hook into this file
  - Add an enum for it either in InputHookType or OutputHookType

Example usage:

  import hook_factory
  bq_hook = hook_factory.get_input_hook(InputHookType.BIG_QUERY,
                                        bq_arg1, bq_arg2,...)
  ga_hook = hook_factory.get_output_hook(OutputHookType.GOOGLE_ANALYTICS,
                                         ga_arg1, ga_arg2, ...)
