    The returned generator will go over all the events in the input source based
    on the specified location given to the class at init time.

    The yielded blobs will contain:
     - An events list consisting of all the events in the blob
     - The input location
     - The location of the blob inside the input source
     - Number of events in blob.

    A blob with an empty events list will be generated if the blob was indeed
    empty. If an error ocurred during reading or parsing the blob's contents
    this blob will be skipped and not generated.
    Args:
      processed_blobs_generator: A generator that provides the processed blob

    Yields:
